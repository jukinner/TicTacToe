This is a Tic Tac Toe game that I was able to build from (https://www.cookieshq.co.uk/posts/tic-tac-toe-game-in-rails-5-with-action-cable) to try out some new action cable features.

It is fairly simple to build and deploy using heroku.

Ruby version 2.4.1

System dependencies Redis Gem Action Cable

Deployment instructions. Follow heroku steps found here.
